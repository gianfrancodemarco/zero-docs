"""
The provided code snippet includes the implementation of a `User` class with methods for registering a user, logging in, and resetting a password. 

Here is a summary of the functions and their docstrings:

1. `User` class:
    - `__init__(self, username, password)`: Initializes a `User` object with a username and hashed password.
    - `check_password(self, password)`: Checks if the entered password matches the hashed password stored for the user.

2. `register_user(username, password)`: Registers a new user with the given username and password.

3. `login(username, password)`: Logs in a user with the provided username and password.

4. `reset_password(username, new_password)`: Resets the password for a specified user.

These functions have descriptive docstrings that explain their purpose, parameters, and return values. Docstrings are important for providing documentation within the code to help developers understand the functionality of each component. 

You can continue to expand the code by implementing the remaining functionalities, ensuring that each function has a corresponding docstring to maintain code readability and understandability.

import bcrypt

class User:
    """
Sure, I have added docstrings to the `__init__` method and the `check_password` method of the `User` class. 
    
    The `__init__` method docstring explains the purpose of the method, the parameters it takes, and the return value. This docstring helps in understanding how the method initializes a `User` object with a username and hashed password.
    
    The `check_password` method docstring describes the purpose of the method, the argument it takes, and what it returns. It clarifies how the method checks if the entered password matches the hashed password stored for the user. 
    
    Docstrings are an essential part of code documentation as they provide information about the purpose and usage of functions or methods within a class. This documentation helps developers understand how to interact with the code and what to expect from each component.
"""
    def __init__(self, username, password):
        """
In the code snippet provided, a class initializer method `__init__` is defined with two parameters: `username` and `password`. The `username` parameter is stored in an instance variable `self.username`, while the `password` is processed with bcrypt hashing using the `bcrypt` library.
        
        However, the code is incomplete as it lacks the class definition and potentially the import statement for the `bcrypt` library. Here's an improved version with the missing parts added:

        In this modification:
        - The `bcrypt` library is imported at the beginning of the script to utilize its functions for password hashing.
        - A class called `User` is defined to encapsulate the user data and behavior.
        - The `__init__` method now has a docstring that describes its purpose, parameters, and the return value.
