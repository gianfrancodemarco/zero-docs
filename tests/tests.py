"""
    def __init__(self, username, password):
        """
This code defines an `__init__` method for a class. The `__init__` method is used to initialize the object with the provided `username` and `password` parameters. The `username` is stored in the `self.username` attribute as is, while the `password` is hashed using the `bcrypt` library before storing it in the `self.password` attribute.
        
        Please note that this code assumes that `bcrypt` is imported and available for use. The hashed password is decoded from bytes to a string before storing it. 
        
        The docstring portion of the code appears to be incomplete. A docstring is a string that is placed at the beginning of a module, class, or function definition to provide documentation or information about its purpose, parameters, and expected behavior. You can add detailed information about the class, what it does, and how it works in the docstring like this:
        
        """python
        def __init__(self, username, password):
            """
            Initialize a new object with the provided username and hashed password.
        
            Parameters:
            username (str): The username of the user.
